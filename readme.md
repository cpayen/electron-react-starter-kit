#Electron / React starter kit

> Live editing starter kit for React inside Electron

The aim of the project is to get an easy-to-use and minimalist starter kit with a simple build process.

- Electron + React
- Auto build process (gulp watcher)
- Require in the browser (browserify)
- JSX and ES6 to ES5 (babelify)
- Live reload (electron-reload)

As build process is managed by Gulp, you need to have it installed globally (or to add it manually).

## Installation

```sh
git clone ...
npm install
gulp
npm start
```
